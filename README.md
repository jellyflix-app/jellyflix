Download and extract the version that is most suitable for your system.

You also need to install the following dependencies to run Jellyflix:
```bash
sudo apt install libjsoncpp-dev libsecret-1-0 libmpv-dev mpv
```

If Jellyflix can't launch because it can't find libmpv or has key-ring issues. You can [the documentation below](#linux-1
You might be prompted to choose a password for the keyring. This is a system dialog and not a Jellyflix dialog. The password is used to store the Jellyfin credentials securely.

### Web

The web version is only intended for demo usage and doesn't support all the features. E.g. playback is not supported.

## Contribute

Contributions are much appreciated. You can help the development by:

- opening issues/bug reports
- suggest features or give feedback
- translating the app
- contributing with pull requests

### Translation

We are using a Weblate Instance provided by [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/) for translations. You can find the project [here](https://translate.codeberg.org/engage/jellyflix/). If you want to contribute to the translation, you can create an account on Weblate and start translating.

## Build

Jellyflix is developed in Flutter a cross-platform framework. The programming language is Dart, which is quite easy to learn. <br>
To build the project you need Flutter [installed](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) and at least one supported device/emulator to run the project on. <br>
Then clone the repository and run the following commands.

```
cd jellyflix
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

## Linux

If you want to build Jellyflix for Linux you need some additional dependencies:

```bash
# Flutter needs the following dependencies, if not already installed
sudo apt install clang cmake git ninja-build pkg-config libgtk-3-dev liblzma-dev libstdc++-12-dev

# Jellyflix needs the following additonal dependencies
# Using apt:
sudo apt install libjsoncpp-dev libmpv-dev libsecret-1-dev mpv
# Using dnf:
sudo dnf install jsoncpp-devel libsecret libsecret-devel mpv mpv-libs mpv-devel
```

Apart from libsecret you also need a keyring service, for that you need either gnome-keyring (for Gnome users) or ksecretsservice (for KDE users) or other light provider like [secret-service](https://github.com/yousefvand/secret-service).

If your distro only provides libmpv, this workaround is necessary:

```bash
# Debian based:
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libmpv.so.2 /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libmpv.so.1
# Fedora based:
sudo ln -s /usr/lib64/libmpv.so /usr/lib64/libmpv.so.1
```

#### We would welcome the contribution of build instructions for Fedora. Unfortunately, as of now, there are no developers using Fedora-like systems.
